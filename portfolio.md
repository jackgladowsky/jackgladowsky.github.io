# Project Portfolio
Welcome to my Project Portfolio! This is most of the projects I have created/worked on from my classes, NURobotics, and personal projects.
I will be updating this page with new projects as I start them!

* [Robot Arm](/robot-arm/)
    * This was a final project for my Embedded Design course where we designed
    a program to control a robotic arm using an FPGA.
* [Mitosis](/mitosis/)
    * This is a fully custom 3D printed 3D printer. I am the Electrical Lead for 
    the project where I am in charge of creating the custom Marlin firmware to run
    the printer and also am in charge of the wiring for the printer. Also working 
    on creating a custom motherboard for the printer.
* [Smart Soles](/smartsoles/)
    * This was a startup where we designed an insole that had sensors
    embedded into it. The sensors would give you data on your running and also general 
    health information just from the insole. I was the techincal lead for this project
    where I designed the schematic and PCB for the custom insole. 
* [Redz Skis](https://www.redzskis.com/)
    * This is a small online shop where I sell miniature skis, snowboards, and rails for your fingers. I designed
    all of them using CAD, and I print them using my 3D printer. I was also in charge of designing
    the website and packaging and shipping out orders.
