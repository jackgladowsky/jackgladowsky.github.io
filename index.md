# About Me

Hi, I'm Jack! I am entering my third year as an undergraduate student 
at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) where I study Computer Engineering!
I am extremly interested in **Embedded Hardware and Software** and am seeking co-op opportunities 
for Spring 2024. 

I created this website as a portfolio/resume/blog to talk about my past experiences and projects!

Please check out my [Resume](/resume/) and my [Project Portfolio](/portfolio/).
