# About Me

Hi, I'm Jack! I am entering my third year as an undergraduate student 
at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) where I study Computer Engineering!
I am extremly interested in **Embedded Hardware and Software** and am seeking co-op opportunities 
for Spring 2024. 

For the last 8 months, I worked as a Quality Engineering co-op at [Lumicell Inc.](https://lumicell.com/),
where I authored numerous software design lifecycle deliverables such as software verification/validation, 
conducted usability sessions to gather and analyze data on the reproccesing workflow, and also executed several
hardware protocols to verify that our test protocols were being executed properly and gathering the necessary data.

I am also an active member of [NURobotics](https://web.northeastern.edu/nurobotics/) where I was the lead electrical engineering on Project Mitosis, a fully 3D printed 3D printer, and also the lab manager where we took care of the 3D printers and other tools the club had to offer.
